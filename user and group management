SSH Access Management
SSH access is managed through configuration files and user-specific settings.

Modify SSH Configuration
To modify SSH server configuration settings, edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Make changes such as allowing or denying SSH access, specifying SSH port, etc.

Allow SSH Access for a User
To allow SSH access for a user, ensure that the user has a valid shell and add their public SSH key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file in their home directory.

Deny SSH Access for a User
To deny SSH access for a user, remove their public SSH key from the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file in their home directory.
