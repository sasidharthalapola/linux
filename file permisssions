## File Permissions

File permissions control access to files and directories on a Linux system. They specify who can read, write, or execute a file, and are represented by the symbolic notation (e.g., rwxr-xr--).
In addition to permissions, each file also has an owner and a group associated with it.

### Permissions

The permission string for a file consists of three sets of permissions, each represented by three characters:
- The first set represents the owner's permissions.
- The second set represents the group's permissions.
- The third set represents permissions for others (users not in the owner group).

Each set of permissions consists of three characters:
- `r` (read): Allows reading the file.
- `w` (write): Allows modifying the file (writing to or deleting).
- `x` (execute): Allows executing the file if it is a program or script.

### Ownership

Each file in Linux has an owner and a group associated with it. The owner is typically the user who created the file, while the group is a collection of users who have certain permissions to the file.

To view the owner and group of a file, you can use the `ls -l` command, which displays detailed information about files and directories, including ownership and permissions.

#### Example
-rw-r--r-- 1 user1 users 1024 Apr 12 10:00 example.txt

In this example, `user1` is the owner of the file `example.txt`, and `users` is the group associated with it.
